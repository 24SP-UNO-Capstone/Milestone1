- First meeting for Master Capstone


### Pre Meeting Questions/thoughts/notes

- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) framework for businesses
	- Essentially create a framework for smaller security teams to create their own CTI program that can be leverages to identify specific threats/weaknesses/vulnerabilities within in an environment
		- Through weighing standard IOCs (IP Addresses, Hashes, Domain Names, FileNames, Paths, Etc.)
		- Or TTPs associated with threat actors.
	- Question: What would our program do that premium products like Mandiant Advantage or CrowdStrike Threat Intelligence or Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence already do?
		- Is this a methodology to collecting, aggregating, and acting based on a defined set of rules/characteristics
	- How do we limit the scope to a bearable level? The initial presentation introduced network, endpoint, and email security technologies. Where do we draw the line between Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting.
