## Executive Project Summary
In today's ultra-connected business world, organizations can no longer afford to be reactive in their cybersecurity posture.  Emerging threats are discovered daily and adversaires often exploit 0-day vulnerabilities with increasing success.  A proactive response is needed to ensure all assets are sufficiently secured.  This project will explore and compile a framework to be applied in a multitude of scenarios to best protect an organization's most critical infastructure.
