https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html - Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™).  Maybe not a true CTI framework, brings up some good elements that can add to a framework.  Very thorough on defninitions, but sometimes feels like just a glossary of terms.
https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html - Sort of an anti-CTI framework.  Approaches the elements of an attack from the attacker's POV.  Could use these points to reubuke their effectiveness in our methodology.

"Threat modeling is the intersection of what an organization has that an adversary might target."   "If teams focus on all threats, they’re going to get burnt out. Instead, ask, “What does our organization have that adversaries might want?”"
