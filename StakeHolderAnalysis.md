Audience 

This report is intended for IT staff with a focus on cybersecurity obligations in addition to personnel in a security analyst, security engineer, architect, or cybersecurity manager role. It has been designed specifically for organizations that have little or zero financial budget designated for Cyber Threat Intelligence goals, however, still want to improve their intelligence capabilities. 

The suggested development and operational tasks in this report are designed to reduce hands-on responsibilities and recommend automation wherever possible. This CTI model makes the assumption that most organizations do not have full-time equivalent staff available, and this model must be able to operate with limited maintenance or dedicated resources. 

This guide is technical in nature but is written to benefit readers of all cybersecurity experience levels. Organizations may implement the entire framework as written or adopt individual pieces as needed to meet their needs.
