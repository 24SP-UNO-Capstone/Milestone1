## Executive Project Summary
---
In today's ultra-connected business world, organizations can no longer afford to be reactive in their cybersecurity posture.  Emerging threats are discovered daily and adversaires often exploit 0-day vulnerabilities with increasing success.  A proactive response is needed to ensure all assets are sufficiently secured.  This project will explore and compile a framework to be applied in a multitude of scenarios to best protect an organization's most critical infastructure.

The goal of the project is to create an open source guide to creating an effective cyber threat intelligence (CTI) program for small and medium businesses. 

In order to achieve this goal, we will utilize prior works in this sector, as well as, identify open source, value add tools that can provide threat intelligence to emerging CTI programs.

## Risk list
---
|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Skillset limitations (32) | 4 | 8 | Due to the diverse nature of IT and Cybersecurity, some members of the group (all of us) may not have been exposed to different methodologies and techniques of conducting necessary tasks. In order to combat this, we will work together to learn as necessary to better the team as a whole. |

=======
| Student availability (56) | 8 | 7 | Due to the team having professional careers and lives outside of CYBR8950, it is likely there will be scheduling limitation and conflicts that occur. This will lead to a major impact as the workload must be distributed evenly to be successful. |
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
| Open Source License Restrictions (48) | 6 | 8 | Open-source technologies while free to use individually, may have certain restrictions placed on them in the business environment. Seeing as this is the case we will identify those tools, and document the proper method of using the tool and alternatives that do not have this restriction. |
| Access to technological resources (21) | 3 | 7 | Given the scope of the project in CTI, it is likely we will not have access to a number of business grade tooling that would otherwise be available to the consumers of this guide. Given this we can identify Open-Source or Free work arounds to appropriately test and convery the success of this guide. |
| Lack of prior works (42) | 7 | 6 | As is standard for research related topics, there can exist a hole in relevant related works. In order to mitigate this risk, we will utilize a number of diverse sources of information includeing academic journals, blogs, websites, and books. |

## Project Methodology
---
1. Conduct stake holder analysis to identify audience and their relevant needs to target needs based on organization size.
2. Research and review relevant documents related to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), prior CTI program guides, tooling, and other relevant literature. This step will be used to identify best practices, successful methodologies, useful tools, etc.
3. Utilizing the relevant literature create solutions to documented issues with prior implementations of CTI program guides and best practices.

#### Literature Review
---
The concept of Cyber Threat Intelligence as a preventive defense plan has attracted considerable attention across the industry in recent years.  Existing literature from corporate entities such as Lockheed Martin's [Cyber Kill Chain](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) framework or Mandiant's [CTI Analyst Core Competencies Framework](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/cti-analyst-core-competencies-framework) can provide a basis for a robust cybersecurity defense portfolio.  Additionally, academic efforts have also provided their own CTI frameworks, with [The Diamond Model](https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/diamond-model-intrusion-analysis) as a prime example.  Other academic works include: [TINKER: A framework for Open source Cyberthreat Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05571). 

Further supporting documents like the [Structured Threat Information Expression (STIXâ„¢)](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html) from Oasis Open provide terminology and relational guidance when classifying potential threats.  


## Resources Needed

## First Sprint Plan
---
**Tasks:**
Group Tasks:
- Research prior CTI methodologies, implementations, and short comings
  - Document issues with prior
  - Document successful/good ideas
  - Document things we can take and implement/improve on
    - **we are not reinventing the wheel** - merely applying some tire shine :)

Task
 - Identify Opensource CTI related tools that can be used
 - Identify Threat intelligence feeds that can be used
   - Cost/license agreement
