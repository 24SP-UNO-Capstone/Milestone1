## Executive Project Summary
In today's ultra-connected business world, organizations can no longer afford to be reactive in their cybersecurity posture.  Emerging threats are discovered daily and adversaires often exploit 0-day vulnerabilities with increasing success.  A proactive response is needed to ensure all assets are sufficiently secured.  This project will explore and compile a framework to be applied in a multitude of scenarios to best protect an organization's most critical infastructure.

The goal of the project is to create an open source guide to creating an effective cyber threat intelligence (CTI) program for small and medium businesses. 

In order to achieve this goal, we will utilize prior works in this sector, as well as, identify open source, value add tools that can provide threat intelligence to emerging CTI programs.

## Risk list
Cost of License
Breaching License Agreement
Student availability
Skillset limitations

|Risk name (value)  | Impact     | Likelihood | Description |
|-------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Skillset limitations (32) | 4 | 8 | Due to the diverse nature of IT and Cybersecurity, some members of the group (all of us) may not have been exposed to different methodologies and techniques of conducting necessary tasks. In order to combat this, we will work together to learn as necessary to better the team as a whole. |
| Student availability (56) | 8 | 7 | FIX THIS |
| Open Source License Restrictions (48) | 6 | 8 | Open-source technologies while free to use individually, may have certain restrictions placed on them in the business environment. Seeing as this is the case we will identify those tools, and document the proper method of using the tool and alternatives that do not have this restriction. |
| Access to technological resources (21) | 3 | 7 | Given the scope of the project in CTI, it is likely we will not have access to a number of business grade tooling that would otherwise be available to the consumers of this guide. Given this we can identify Open-Source or Free work arounds to appropriately test and convery the success of this guide. |
| Lack of prior works (42) | 7 | 6 | As is standard for research related topics, there can exist a hole in relevant related works. In order to mitigate this risk, we will utilize a number of diverse sources of information includeing academic journals, blogs, websites, and books. |

## First Sprint Plan
---
**Tasks:**
Group Tasks:
- Research prior CTI methodologies, implementations, and short comings
  - Document issues with prior
  - Document successful/good ideas
  - Document things we can take and implement/improve on
    - **we are not reinventing the wheel** - merely applying some tire shine :)

Task
 - Identify Opensource CTI related tools that can be used
 - Identify Threat intelligence feeds that can be used
