# CYBR4580/8950 Project Milestone 2: Prototype and Research Paper Outline

## Setup Environments

1. Setup a Proof-of-Concept Taxii \ STIX automation 

## Project Realization 

TBD

## Research Paper Outline
 - **Executive Summary**
   - Stakeholder Analysis \ Audience section 
   - Brief section: What is Threat Intel, how is it used, benefits of it
   - Brief section: The Intelligence Life Cycle, The Diamond Model
   - Brief section: Stix, TAXII, possible automation of threat intel
 - **Describe the requirements for a Threat intel program**
   - Server needed to run the automation of tasks
     - Run via lambda functions instead?  
   - Collection of known utilized software to check for CVEs
   - Possible sec-ops pipeline to feed intel into security tools
     - SOAR?
     - python?
     - API integrations required?
   - FTE hours required to manage \ maintain
     
 - **Our suggested threat intel framework**
   - Recommended threat intel feeds to monitor
     - Describe the benefits each feed offers.
     - Describe possible automated actions with feeds
     - Describe feeds that require manual intervention
       - CISA known exploited CVEs
       - ISAC Center Alerting
   - Recommended actions to take with the newly collected intel
     - Blocking IPs in firewalls
     - Blocking Hashes in AV
     - Build detections for TTPs
   - Examples of Reports that can be generated with Threat Intel
   - Examples of how threat intel analysts can provide value to their organizations
